### 1. Functional organization of the nervous system
- sensory input (receptors, peripheral nervoussystem - PNS) -> information processing (integreation, central-nervoussystem - ZNS) -> motor output (muscles, PNS)

### 2. Development of nervous systems
#### **"Lowest" organism with a neruronal network: Cnidaria (polyps and medusae)**
- the Tripedalia cystophora has a powerful sensorric system
    - total of 24 eyes

**Characteristics of Hydra:**
- nerve cells are connected to a network containing aggregates (nerve rings, ganglia)
- no central nervous systems (CNS)
- no myelinization
- symmetrical synapsesm(no distinction between axons and dendrites)
- peptide neurotransmitters (no low molecular weight transmitters)

**&rarr; begin of a functional differentiation**

net of multipolar nerve cells below the epithelial cell layer in connection to sensory cells ( "exumbrellar nerve ring"): senesory function

net of nerve cells on top of muscle cells ("subumbrellar nerve...

#### **"Lowest" organism with a central nervous system: Plathelminthes and Nemathelminthes (flatworms and roundworms)**
- contain a body axis
- contain a spezialized head region ("cephalization")
- contain an accumulation of nerve cells in the head region ("brain")

Important model system: Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm, nematode)

**Control of the development of the nervous system**
**Two principal mechanisms:**
- hard-wired molecular programs (DNA sequence)
- epigenetic processes (in a broad sense: anything oter than DNA sequence that influences development)
    - example: limiting amount of neurotrophins determines number of surviving neurons
    - concequence of epigenetic processes: you never have a predetermined number of neurons



### 3. Nervous systems of vertebrates
- increasedtendency of centralization and cephalization:

    Humans:
    - majority of neurons in brain
    - 99.999% of neurons are interneurons

**PNS**: groups of neurons (ganglia) and peripheral nerve tracks
- somatic part
- autonomous (vegetative) part
    - sympathic (increase of activation)
    - parasympathic (decrease of activation)

**Central nervous system (CNS)**
Dorsally positioned tube-like nerve strand (produced by invagination of the ectoderm)

&rarr; posterior part (spinal cord)\
&rarr; anterior part (vesicles, brain (segmental structure, present in both hemispheres of the brain))

- segmented organization (31 paired spinal nerves in 4 major regions)
- H-like structure: gray and surrounding white matter
- divides into dorsal and ventral horn and dorsal, lateral, and ventral columns

**Embryonic development and organization of the brain:**
5 parts in the adult brain:

- **Forebrain**
    - telencephalon ("Endhirn")
    - diencephalon ("Zwischenhirn")

- **Brainstem**
    - mesencephalon ("Mittelhirn)
    - **Hindbrain**
        - metencephalon ("Hinterhirn")
        - myelencephalon ("Nachhirn")

**Principles that govern the organization of the CNS**

Seperation of the CNS in gray and white matter.

Functionality of the CNS requires optimization of two competing requirements:
- high interconnectivity
- short conduction delays

&rarr; Solution: Segregation between gray and white matter:
- high connectivity in small regions ("local connections") (maximal number of cells: about 10 000 neurons with tolerable delay (ms range)) &rarr; gray matter
- fast connections with high conduction speed ("global wiring") &rarr; white matter

.
- *Serial organization**("relays"); information is transformed at every step
- *Pathways* that link the components ("tracts" oder "Bahnen")
- pathways *cross* to the other part of the body at a certain anatomical level
- projections occur in an orderly fashion thus producing *"neural maps"* ("somatotopy")
